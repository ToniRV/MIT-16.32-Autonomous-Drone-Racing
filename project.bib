@techreport{Bouabdallah,
abstract = {The research on autonomous miniature flying robots has intensified considerably thanks to the recent growth of civil and military interest in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This paper summarizes the final results of the modeling and control parts of OS4 project, which focused on design and control of a quadrotor. It introduces a simulation model which takes into account the variation of the aerodynamical coefficients due to vehicle motion. The control parameters found with this model are successfully used on the helicopter without re-tuning. The last part of this paper describes the control approach (Integral Backstepping) and the scheme we propose for full control of quadrotors (attitude, altitude and position). Finally, the results of autonomous takeoff , hover, landing and collision avoidance are presented.},

@article{Sabatino2015,
abstract = {In this work, a mathematical model of a quadrotor's dynamics is derived, using Newton's and Euler's laws. A linearized version of the model is obtained, and therefore a linear controller, the Linear Quadratic Regulator, is derived. After that, two feedback linearization control schemes are designed. The first one is the dynamic inversion with zero dynamics stabilization, based on Static Feedback Linearization obtaining a partial linearization of the mathematical model. The second one is the exact linearization and non-interacting control via dynamic feedback, based on Dynamic Feedback Linearization obtaining a total linearization of the mathematical model. Moreover, these nonlinear control strategies are compared with the Linear Quadratic Regulator in terms of performances. Finally, the behavior of the quadrotor under the proposed control strategies is observed in virtual reality by using the Simulink 3D Animation toolbox},

@article{Gibiansky2012,
abstract = {The aim of this work is to study the fundamental Lamb modes interaction with defects in isotropic plates. For these experimental investigations, symmetrical notches with various depths milled in aluminum plates are considered. Moreover, the incident Lamb wave of a specific mode is generated by means of two identical thin piezoceramic transducers placed at the opposite sides of the plate. The waves scattered by the notch are recorded with conventional transducers located on the plate surface in front and behind the defect. The selection of the A0 or the S0 modes is obtained by exciting the transducers with anti-phased or in-phased signals, respectively. Furthermore, a calibration process is investigated to correct errors caused by the presence of the receiver between the emitters and the defects. The power reflection and transmission coefficients are then obtained and the power balance is verified. Finally, these measurements are compared successfully with those obtained by a numerical method using the finite-element modeling described in a previous work. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@inproceedings{Chovancova2014,
abstract = {The paper focuses on mathematical modelling of a quadrotor and identification of parameters used in presented models. There are several models of the quadrotor that can be used to design a controller. The nonlinear model is presented with respect to the body-fixed frame and also to the inertial frame. The next model is defined in terms of quaternions. The last presented mathematical model is a model near a hover position, where some forces and moments can be neglected. Model parameters can be obtained via experimental identification, calculations or the combination of both ways. These parameters are arm length, total mass of the quadrotor, inertia matrix, friction coefficients, thrust coefficient and drag coefficient. Experimental identification of an actuator usually required the usage of a test bed.},
