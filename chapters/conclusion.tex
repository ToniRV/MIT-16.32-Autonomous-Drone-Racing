\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have first presented a nonlinear model of a quadcopter suitable for an accurate representation of the dynamics involved in drone racing.
Then, we have formulated a minimum time optimal control problem in order to estimate the sequence of states and control inputs to finish the race in a minimum amount of time.
Finally, this paper considers the addition of conic constraints on the velocity of the drone to explicitly encode the fact that the drone must fully traverse a gate before heading to the next one.
The results achieved are promising and can be potentially used as a benchmark to assess how close to optimality other approaches are.
