\begin{abstract}
    In light of the recent interest in drone racing, both manned and unmanned, we present an approach to calculate the optimal control inputs and state trajectory of a quadcopter to finish a given race track in a minimum time.
    We assume the race track to consist of a set of arbitrarily positioned gates in 3D that the drone has to go through.
%    We present an optimal control problem to estimate the rotor speed inputs and state sequences to fly a nonlinear model of a quadcopter through such a race track in a minimum time.
    We show how to solve this problem by using \textrm{GPOPS-II}, a matlab-based general purpose optimal control software.
    The hope of this work is to provide useful information for human pilots, and developers of autonomous drones, as would be provided by a tactician in an air race competition.
