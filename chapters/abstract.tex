\begin{abstract}
    We present an optimal control problem to estimate the rotor speed inputs and state sequences to drive a nonlinear model of a quadcopter through a race track in a minimum time.
    We show how to solve this problem by using \textrm{GPOPS-II}, a matlab-based general purpose optimal control software.
