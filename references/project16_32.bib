abstract = {The aim of this work is to study the fundamental Lamb modes interaction with defects in isotropic plates. For these experimental investigations, symmetrical notches with various depths milled in aluminum plates are considered. Moreover, the incident Lamb wave of a specific mode is generated by means of two identical thin piezoceramic transducers placed at the opposite sides of the plate. The waves scattered by the notch are recorded with conventional transducers located on the plate surface in front and behind the defect. The selection of the A0 or the S0 modes is obtained by exciting the transducers with anti-phased or in-phased signals, respectively. Furthermore, a calibration process is investigated to correct errors caused by the presence of the receiver between the emitters and the defects. The power reflection and transmission coefficients are then obtained and the power balance is verified. Finally, these measurements are compared successfully with those obtained by a numerical method using the finite-element modeling described in a previous work. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The paper focuses on mathematical modelling of a quadrotor and identification of parameters used in presented models. There are several models of the quadrotor that can be used to design a controller. The nonlinear model is presented with respect to the body-fixed frame and also to the inertial frame. The next model is defined in terms of quaternions. The last presented mathematical model is a model near a hover position, where some forces and moments can be neglected. Model parameters can be obtained via experimental identification, calculations or the combination of both ways. These parameters are arm length, total mass of the quadrotor, inertia matrix, friction coefficients, thrust coefficient and drag coefficient. Experimental identification of an actuator usually required the usage of a test bed.},
